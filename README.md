<br>This application dynamically calculates the most cost-effective recipes for leveling any crafting profession in World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King Classic. Unlike existing profession leveling guides, which are handwritten and static, my tool takes into account real-time price variations based on server and faction.</p>
<br/>

<h2>Home Page</h2>

<p>The user is initially prompted to make selections and can choose their desired profession (and starting level) as well as their server and faction. The displayed choices are selected by default.</p>

<h2>Leveling Guide</h2>
<img src="./readme_screenshots/Calculate1.png"/>
<p>After making selections and pressing calculate, a leveling guide and associated shopping list are displayed.</p>

<h2>Shopping List</h2>
<img src="./readme_screenshots/ShoppingList.png"/>
<p>The shopping list is a collapsible menu that provides a simple list of all the items a player must acquire before starting. This menu also displays the current total cost of all required items.</p>

<h2>Expandable Items</h2>
<img src="./readme_screenshots/RecipeExpand.png"/>
<p>Individual recipe items can be expanded to view the required materials specific to that recipe. Also note the scrolling selection menu for usability.</p>

<h2>Item Hover</h2>
<img src="./readme_screenshots/Hover.png"/>
<p>All items (both recipes and reagents) link to their wowhead webpage and are also hoverable for a quick preview.</p>

<h2>Selection Demo</h2>
<img src="./readme_screenshots/AlternativeSelection.png"/>
<p>Here the user has selected the Alchemy profession on the Ashkandi server, Horde.</p>

<h2>Unpopulated Realms</h2>
<img src="./readme_screenshots/DeadServer.png"/>
<p>Not all server and faction combinations have a sufficient player population or enough 
items on the market to support leveling a profession. An error message is displayed and
user is prompted to make another selection.</p>
